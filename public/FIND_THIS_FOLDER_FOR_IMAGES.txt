Hello! If you can see this file, you have found the 'public' folder.

This is where you should place static assets for your Next.js application, like images.

For your profile picture:
1. Upload your photo directly into THIS 'public' folder.
2. Make sure the photo is named exactly: your-profile-photo.jpg

The application has been updated to look for 'your-profile-photo.jpg' directly in this 'public' folder.
